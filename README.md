# Geocortex_workflows
XAML based workflows for use with the Geocortex GIS platform by Latitude Geographics


Each file is a separate workflow.  Hopefully the names make sense enough to figure out what they are with having to read the summary of each file.

To use these files, either download the whole folder as a zip file and open each file as you would with the workflow designer.
Or you can open the workflow you are interested in and copy/paste the code into notepad, save the file as 'yourfilename'.xaml and then open that file in workflow designer.
